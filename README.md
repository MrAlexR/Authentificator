# Second-Java-Program
This is my second Java App.
In this app, I reproduced in a very basic and simple manner, a method of connecting to an account without the need of having to remember or set a password for it.
The client has a small device (simulated as a simple GUI) with an embedded app that requests a password from the server for the specific username. The server then generates a passcode (four numbers separated by a line), which is going to last a certain amount of time (maximum 1 minute). The passcode gets removed from the asociated user (from the server) when the user has used the passcode to log in.
Keep in mind this is my second Java program, so i guess I might have left some bugs up there !
